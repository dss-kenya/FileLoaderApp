# FileLoaderApp

This application contains a library that can be used to download images. There are several image loading libraries but this was a just to trial to developing an image loading library from scratch, storing the images in cache and allowing multiple requests. 

<ul>The library is called: **fileloaderlib**</ul>

And it used **RxJava** and **Retrofit** for image loading purposes.

<ul>
More can be added to this library like:
  <li>1. Downloading all types of files</li>
  <li>2. Improving cache mechanisms</li>
  <li>3. Allowing the cancellations of requests.</li>
</ul>

The pattern followed for the main app is **MVP with some modifications like using Interactors**.
